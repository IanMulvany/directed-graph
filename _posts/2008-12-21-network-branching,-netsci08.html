<div><br />        <p>I'm really torn by the number of great talks on today. There are three<br /><br />parallel sessions, and for each time slot I want to be in at least two<br /><br />places at once. I'm going to try to pick out talks that have some<br /><br />relation to online social networks, community detection and scientific<br /><br />networks, but some of the talks on the theory of clustering are<br /><br />conflicting directly with some use cases of looking at some online<br /><br />social networks. Ahh, what a dilemma.</p><br /><br /><p>The opening talk of this session was from Stwphen Uzzo talking about the</p><br /><br /><p>The next talk was by M.C Gonzales looking at the network of travel<br /><br />patterns. This was the paper that made the cover of Nature.</p><br /><br /><p>The big question is trying to find out what the travel patterns of<br /><br />people are. Thhe big problem is that getting data is apparently quite<br /><br />hard.</p><br /><br /><p>The solution is to follow mobile phone signals, following 10^5 people over<br /><br />10^6 locations over six months.</p><br /><br /><p>I'm looking at the movie of their data, and it is clear that many people<br /><br />don't move very much, and other people move a lot. Of course one wants<br /><br />to know some information about the people to see what effect like age,<br /><br />wealth and occupation will have on these results. Again I'm looking for<br /><br />something surprising.</p><br /><br /><p>There is a nice graph showing corellation over time, it is hugly spiked<br /><br />on 24 hours. Not surprising, but a good reality check on the data.</p><br /><br /><p>I'm going to head to one of the other sessions after this talk.</p><br /><br /><p>This talk, though, is very nice. Once again there is evedence that our<br /><br />behaviour is depressingly regular. Also the longer a journey the more likely<br /><br />that a journey is going to be linear.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/network-branching-netsci08.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fa968233e80003?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
