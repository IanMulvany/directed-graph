<div><br />        <p>I've just signed up for an account with twidox, which is a start up<br /><br />that is collecting shared documents of interest to scientists, I<br /><br />believe. They are in the private beta stage, but had a link on their<br /><br />homepage for requesting an account. I got the following message when I<br /><br />hit the verification link:</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />Registration is taking place!</p><br /><br /><p>Many thanks for you interest in twidox. Your account has been activated.<br /><br />We will send you your private-beta lock-in details very soon.</p><br /><br /><p>We thank you for your support.</p><br /><br /><p>Your twidox-team</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/i-didnt-expect-lock-in-so-quickly.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fad69152480005?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
