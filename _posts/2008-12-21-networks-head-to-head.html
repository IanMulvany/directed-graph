title: networks; head to head

<div><br />        <p>The second talk in the evening CREEN parallel session is from J. Holyst<br /><br />about phase transitions in coupled complex networks where the network<br /><br />properties are different in the two groups.</p><br /><br /><p>In one group there are a smaller number of members, but they are tightly<br /><br />coupled. The second group is larger, but less tightly coupled. The model<br /><br />uses an Ising model. The less coupled group has higher fluctuation in<br /><br />opinion, and when it is brought into contact with the smaller group the<br /><br />larger group undergoes a phase transition. To reverse the process if you<br /><br />can find a hub in the tightly coupled system then when you convince them<br /><br />their opinions gain traction.</p><br /><br /><p>This is a really nice paper and there are obvious tendancies to draw<br /><br />parallels with real communities, such as for example two scientific<br /><br />communities, or an immigrant community, but I am fairly certain that<br /><br />this would at the moment be too simplistic.</p><br /><br /><p>He goes on to show a face off between ER graphs vs BA graphs, and this<br /><br />shows that network structure has signifigant effect on the suseptability<br /><br />of the community to opinion change.</p><br /><br /><p>One big application could be to look at these results in the context of<br /><br />the new vote that Ireland will probably undergo early next year to<br /><br />re-ratify the Lison treaty (I mean, I assume that is what is going to<br /><br />happen in Ireland next year).</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/networks-head-to-head.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fae8c6339f000b?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
