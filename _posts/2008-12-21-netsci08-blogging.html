<div><br />        <p>I'm in Norwich all this week attending Netsci08<br /><br />http://www.ifr.ac.uk/netsci08/, the internatinal workshop and conference<br /><br />on network science. It's a week long event, and broadly speaking it<br /><br />looks like there are three types themes that are being discussed here:<br /><br />biological networks, pure networks science and community detection in<br /><br />networks, principlaly emergent networks of the kind we see in the<br /><br />internet.</p><br /><br /><p>I'm twittering about the meeting using the tag #netsci08, but it seems<br /><br />that I'm the only one out there in the twitterverse who is also at this<br /><br />meeting. Not enough power in the lecture hall, and wifi is a little<br /><br />ropey, but the conference is pretty good so far.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />The talks on Monday were about some basics on network mathematics, and<br /><br />on network science in the social sciences. I'll go back over my notes<br /><br />and give a quick report on them when I get a chance to catchup, but the<br /><br />discussion in the evening was pretty interesting, and the talk in the<br /><br />morning touced on some very important topics.</p><br /><br /><p>The Tuesday morning tutorial is on economics and networks. The morning<br /><br />model was very simple, and I think that's fair enough, but I got the<br /><br />feeling that the level of the audience, at least on the side of the room<br /><br />that I am sitting on, was high enough to have taken a bit more robust<br /><br />model, so I got the feeling that there was some discomfot with the model<br /><br />presented.</p><br /><br /><p>The after-coffee section is focussing on social influencers, now this is<br /><br />interesting.</p><br /><br /><p>How is it that information flow is highly assymetric in the world?</p><br /><br /><p>The model is a mmulti-state model with differeing outcomes. Individuals<br /><br />don't know the true state of the system, but they have beliefs about the<br /><br />states. Sounds like a hidden markov model.</p><br /><br /><p>The model is stationary, and we want to see how the choices we make<br /><br />change the beliefs that we have. Could be a bayseian network? Let's see.<br /><br />What I am hoping to see from this model is how reccomendations can<br /><br />travel throgh a network. There is a network of communication between the<br /><br />network. The model can integrate dynamics, the dynamics of belief.</p><br /><br /><p>There is also feedback between actions and beliefs. The main result is<br /><br />that as time goes by new information has less effect, and so beliefs<br /><br />converge in the network. This is a consequence of Martingale's theorm.</p><br /><br /><p>The big question is whether we get optimal actions, and the big result<br /><br />is that the ability to explore the action space and find the best action<br /><br />is depenant upon the structure of the network. That is really<br /><br />interesting.</p><br /><br /><p>Oh my God, someone has an OLPC machine in the audience, how cool is<br /><br />that!!</p><br /><br /><p>Anyway, back to the talk. So this is indeed a Bayseian network. The<br /><br />anti-intutive outcome from this model is that if you have to build a one<br /><br />time only network that can't be changed later, then you have the best<br /><br />chance of getting optimal behaviour if no one person has undue<br /><br />influence, hoever I think that for online social networks there is a lot<br /><br />of dunamics going on that can pull you out of local sub-optimal minima.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/netsci08-blogginh.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fad693bf6d0005?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
