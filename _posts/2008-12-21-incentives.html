<div><br />        <p>So after reading about some economists who decided to use economic theory to<br /><br />loose weight I have decided to follow suit. They both decided to loose a<br /><br />certain amount of weight by a certain time and places $5000 in a bond.<br /><br />Whoever didn't make the weight lost their portion of the money to the other<br /><br />person. The idea was to affect behavior through an incentive that<br /><br />was significant. Well, I'm not a well paid economist, but I have decided to<br /><br />follow their example.<br /><br />A couple of years ago, back in 2004, my weight had leveled out at 80kg. I<br /><br />kept a daily record as part of a climbing training log, and it actually<br /><br />varied over the year between 77.4 and 80.6 depending on how much climbing<br /><br />i'd been doing.</p><br /><br /><p>Then I moved to The Netherlands and within 18 months had put on 15 kg.<br /><br />Welll, I'm back down to 85, but those last 5kg have been hell to get rid of,<br /><br />so tonight I made a bet with my girlfriend. If I don't lose those 5kg within<br /><br />5 months then I pay her 400 british pounds sterling. That gives me until the<br /><br />1st of August.</p><br /><br /><p>I reckon I need to run/walk about 100 kms a month to hit the target. I'm<br /><br />already walking 3km a day to work, and 3 back again. If I were to walk to<br /><br />work every day that would already be close to 120 km, so it's within the<br /><br />realm of possibility. Even more so if I can stop having those sneaky beers<br /><br />in the evening.</p><br /><br /><p>Spurred on by this new motivation I just went for a 6.6 km run, phew.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/incentives.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00e398deb0e40004?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
