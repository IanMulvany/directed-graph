title: drowning in the streamosphere
---
<div><br />        <p>I've been thinking about the streamosphere (as coined by Euan Adie),<br /><br />and how I am starting to get dragged down in it again. I'm getting<br /><br />daily notifications from pounce, twitter, friendfeed, linked in (I've<br /><br />been ignoring facebook for ages, facebook, you bite my ass). What I<br /><br />really need is a way to manage my notifications and communications in<br /><br />the way that I now manage my rss feeds, through a bespoke piece of<br /><br />aggregation kit.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/drowning-in-the-streamosphere.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fad68a8f590004?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
