title: Testing out a new blog platform
---
<div><br />    <br />    <br />        <br />            <br />            <p>So, I've been having some problems with the Vox service for some time,<br /><br />and now I have a twine invitation, so I am going to test out Twine as<br /><br />a platform for blogging.</p><br /><br /><p>The way I blog is that I tend to write up my blog posts in a mail<br /><br />client and then mail these to the blog engine, but so far Vox as a<br /><br />service has been soso.</p><br /><br /><p>For the next while I am going to try posting the same content to both<br /><br />locations and I'll see which one I like most. Ultimately I want to<br /><br />mirror this content on my own domain/site.</p><br /><br /><p>One of the problems that it has been having is mis-rendering html,<br /><br />let's see if I can get a link to my home page working in this post,<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mulvany.net">mulvany.net</a></p><br />        <br />    <br />                <p><br /><br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/testing-out-a-new-blog-platform.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a><br /><br /> | <br /><br />    <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00e398f4f9450004?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a><br /><br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
