title: Training Diary Catchup

OK, so, I've fallen off the wagon in terms of climbing training, or in fact training of any kind.<br /><br />Last weekend was interesting. I did the introductory PADI course, but the week leading up to the weekend was swamped with work, and all of the nights of this week have filled up too. I think in order to get my running done I am going to have to transition to a morning run a few times a week.<br /><br />I can give this a try tomorrow and see how it goes. I managed to get my bike road worthy again last night, so that will help with the amount of time I have free in the mornings. <br /><br />Liowlights: <br />not finding the time to get any training done.<br /><br />Hilights:<br />So there have been some hilights. <br /><br />- Diving for the first time, even if it was only in the pool.<br />- Last Monday week ago, nearly onsighting a 6c at the wall. My goal is to tick a 6c some time in March, so that was very promising.<br />- I tried to get back on the fingerboard again this week, but found it very hard. No power, no motivation. This is actually in the hilight column, as if I can actually get some power back in my hands, given how well I was climbing at the wall recently I should see some improvements!! Let's see how she goes.
