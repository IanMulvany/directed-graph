I don't post my poetry often, indeed I don't write often, but I thought this one came out OK. Written over the past weekend for a good friend on the occasion of her birthday.<br /><br /><pre><br />Edinburgh, first draft, 01/05/2010<br /><br />for andrea.<br /><br />Was it in Summer, when I lost myself among the graveyards?<br />The moss covered steps of Greyfriars green and gleaming.<br /><br />Or was it someone's winter night along cobbled streets, <br />where buildings wear a sharp puritan cut to their overcoats?<br />Hightailing it though the cold from one warm pub to the next.<br /><br />Could it have been an Edinburgh Spring?<br />Beltaine roared along High Street in the gloaming<br />The burning processing smoking up the back of Calton Hill<br />A firebreather bellowed,<br />Gouts of flame framed faces.<br /><br />If not in these times, <br />then it must have been an Autumn loamy wet and windswept afternoon.<br />Sitting in the back of an Elephant,<br />last light out of the west washing against the castle.<br /><br />It threaded itself, wound round us,<br />as we wandered Whitehouse Loan,<br />High Riggs, West Port, and up the Vennel Steps. <br /><br />In such moments that city passed beyond us being there,<br /> and into our dreams.<br /></pre>
