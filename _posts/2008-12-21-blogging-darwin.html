<div><br />        <p>One of my friends is writing a series of blogs about Darwin.</p><br /><br /><p>It looks like a very nice series of blog posts, and I look forward to the<br /><br />rest.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />You can read it <a>here</a>.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />Of course as a physicist I disagree with one comment in this first post:</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />&quot;From an intellectual point of view, the Origin is the most significant work<br /><br />of the millennium, and the most important work of non-fiction ever.&quot;</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />I would vote the atomic hypothesis into that position, with, in addion, a<br /><br />nod to deep time and the extragalactic distance scale, but we each have our<br /><br />own scientific peccadilloes so I won't argue too much on the point.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/blogging-darwin.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00e398dbec120003?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
