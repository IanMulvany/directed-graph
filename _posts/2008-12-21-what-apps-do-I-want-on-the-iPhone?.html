title: what apps do I want on the iPhone?
---
<div><br />        <p>Well, I just read through the engadget report on the iPhone SDK and it's<br /><br />looking pretty good. I'm in the middle of downloading the free SDK, mainly<br /><br />so that I can have a virtual iPhone to play around with, but last night I<br /><br />got to thinking about what kind of applications I personally would like to<br /><br />see on the device.<br /><br />I live in London, but I frequently travel to Europe. I have friends that I<br /><br />like to keep in contact with in the US as well. Most UK mobile phone<br /><br />contracts suck for someone whose social network is evenly distributed across<br /><br />the world. Data rates through T-Mobile when I go the the mainland are<br /><br />exorbitant, and I only use my N95 as a camera on such occasions cos I can't<br /><br />afford to check email or look at maps. The two main problems with mobile<br /><br />tech in Europe at the moment are:</p><br /><br /><p>1. No single european-wide tariff for data and calls. As long as the phone<br /><br />companies get away with making pots of cash it's going to remain this way,<br /><br />sigh.</p><br /><br /><p>2. No free WiFi, it exists in patches, but it's just shit really. One town<br /><br />in Ireland was recently blocked from rolling out free municipal wifi by the<br /><br />EU on the grounds that it was anti-competitive (phone companies might loose<br /><br />revenue). I guess at some point in the future this will change, but for the<br /><br />time being it sucks monkeys.</p><br /><br /><p>So the apps I want to see are:</p><br /><br /><p>1. Offline storage of web content, so that I could process, for example,<br /><br />feeds or emails, while I am in a high danger zone tariff wise.</p><br /><br /><p>2. Offline access to a google-maps kind of an interface. Apparently for the<br /><br />N95 one can download local sheets for areas that you are visiting and browse<br /><br />them whilst offline, but the software for doing this is PC only. I could set<br /><br />up a copy of MS on my mac, but frankly I don't have time. I'd like to be<br /><br />able to dial in a city that I am about to visit, download maps and related<br /><br />info, and then have that on the go while I am tootling around the place.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/what-apps-do-i-want-on-the-iphone.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00e398e384ef0004?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
