title: bus podcast idea
---
<div><br />        <p>I had a great idea yesterday while I was engaged on a personal odyssey on<br /><br />London buses. I was on the top deck of, I think it was the 176, heading down<br /><br />past Old Street into the square mile, round St Paul's (with a quick glimpse<br /><br />of millennium bridge, and then on into the strand. The bus went past so many<br /><br />statues, churches and historical buildings, but I knew only a few of them.<br /><br />It struck me that a podcast that could be used as an audio guide for great<br /><br />bus routes. You could chapter the audio guide by street so that it was easy<br /><br />to navigate according to different traffic conditions.<br /><br />The Dublin Tourist Office does something like this already for walks around<br /><br />the city <a><br /><br />http://www.visitdublin.com/multimedia/DublinPodcasts/iwalk.aspx?id=275</a>,<br /><br />but with London, or other big cities, providing same for bus routes seems<br /><br />like a good idea.</p><br /><br /><p>tags: podcast, idea, cool, london, tourism.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/bus-podcast-idea.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00f48ce2db730002?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
