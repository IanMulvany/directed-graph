title: Predictably Irrational
---
<div><br />        <p>I was in, of all places, Godalming, at the weekend and ended up<br /><br />browsing in a book store for a few moments. I saw what looked like a<br /><br />very interesting book, <br />href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Predictably-Irrational-Hidden-Forces-Decisions/dp/0007256523/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1211186399&amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Predictably<br /><br />Irrational. The book looks at the processes behind bad or<br /><br />irrational decisions. The author is an economist and it seems the aim<br /><br />of the book is to help us to see the emotional effects that influence<br /><br />our decisions, and that lead us to poor decision making. This is a<br /><br />theme that is dear to my heart, as it is closely related to the way<br /><br />that science policy gets determined, insofar as the facts about<br /><br />specific scientific domains are often swamped by emotional reactions<br /><br />to what people think the science is about.</p><br /><br /><p>I didn't buy the book yesterday, as I have a very large current<br /><br />reading list, but not wanting to feel that I was costing myself some<br /><br />opportunity I actually remembered the name of the book. I was<br /><br />delighted this morning when I found that the author has a great <br />href=&quot;http://www.predictablyirrational.com/&quot;&gt;site about the book<br /><br />which includes a <br />href=&quot;http://www.predictablyirrational.com/?page_id=17&quot;&gt;blog. The<br /><br />author Dan Ariely also has a <br />href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ariely&quot;&gt;wikipedia page.<br /><br />From the site and the blog there are links to some papers that seem to<br /><br />form the basis of the book, so now I can get some small chunks to read<br /><br />to satisfy my curiosity about the subject.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/predictably-irrational.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fa9676d5220003?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
