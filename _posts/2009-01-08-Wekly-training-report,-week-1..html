Sunday 4th of January<br>8 km run, in 53 min, average heart rate about 149 bpm.<br><a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2468786">http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2468786</a><p>Monday 5th of January.<br>Did a mini endurance set on my fingerboard. I&#39;ve decided to do a 4<br>week set of power endurance training, with a view to improving my<br>sport grade, just 4 weeks and then<br>I&#39;ll switch to finger strength for four weeks. This bascially hurts<br>and sucks, but hey, that&#39;s what you gotta do. I need to be able to<br>hand from my board for from between<br>3 to 4 minutes, my best time, as of today, is 90 seconds, let&#39;s see if<br>we can improve that shall we.<p>Tuesday 6th, 7.4 km, 50.45 min<br><a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2474102">http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2474102</a><p>Wednesday 7th,<br>Well, I originally wanted to get down to the climbing wall for my<br>first session of the new year, but I was a little wrecked, and decided<br>to have a rest instead.<p>Weekly review,<p>Very happy to have gotten 15km total running in my first week back,<br>and I&#39;m also happy that I&#39;ve decided to try a four week stint just<br>doing Power Endurance, either boulder circuits or exercises on the<br>fingerboard or redpoints. I&#39;ve never had the discipline to keep one<br>format of training going for more than about two weeks before. The<br>goal is also very clear, increase the maximum time that I can hang off<br>of my fingerboard from 90 seconds to more than 90 seconds. This should<br>not be too difficult. The ultimate aim with this is to be able to hang<br>for between three and four minutes, and once I&#39;ve reached that goal,<br>I&#39;ll start adding more resistance to build up a lot of power in that<br>time region.<p>I have decided to recalibrate my training weeks, with day one now<br>being a Saturday, and I&#39;ll be writing up my weekly reports, probably<br>Saturday morning of the new week, so next update a week on Saturday!<p>tags: training, climbing
