title: scribed is cool, but
---
<div><br />        <p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/ipaper">Scribd</a> has rolled out a very nice<br /><br />interface to pdf documents. It is neat and slick, but I think what it is<br /><br />missing is support for getting at data or meta-data in the document. It<br /><br />would be a great boon to be able to click on a table in a document and have<br /><br />that tabular data open either in excel or in some online document tool.<br /><br />Likewise for entities in the document that might have associated metadata.</p><br /><br /><p>I'm sure such support is possible and it would turn a nice tool into an<br /><br />important tool.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/scribed-is-cool-but.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00f48cfbf3ab0001?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
