title: perl and again,
---
<div><br />        <p>Ever since Ian Clarke mentioned the potential delights of python to me<br /><br />whilst passing me in a corridor back in 1999 I've been tinkering around with<br /><br />that language.<br /><br />Christ, that's almost 10 years. I like python, it gave a great sense of<br /><br />freedom after spending a heavy five years working with various flavours of<br /><br />FORTRAN, from<br /><br />FORTRAN 90, through to High Performance Fortran. Well, now here I am<br /><br />tackling perl. It's a gem of a language, but by christ it's scary. The power<br /><br />that it gives you<br /><br />in it's ability to interpret so freely is also it's danger.</p><br /><br /><p>From the end of the introductory chapter from Programming Perl we have:</p><br /><br /><p>&quot;But in the end, you must create you own view of Perl. It's your privilege<br /><br />as an artist to inflict the pain of creativity on yourself. We can teach you<br /><br />how we paint, but we can't teach you how your paint. There's More Than One<br /><br />Way To Do It. Have the appropriate amount of fun.&quot;</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />For writing code at the speed of thought I can see how this is going to be a<br /><br />beguilling language, however for large structured projects it worries me<br /><br />that this language is going to slip out and away from the instantly<br /><br />comprehensible. Perlhaps that's not the case, I guess I'll just have to find<br /><br />out.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/perl-and-again.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00e398d9e8660004?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
