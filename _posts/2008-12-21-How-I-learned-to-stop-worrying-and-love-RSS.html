title: How I learned to stop worrying and love RSS
---
<div><br />    <br />    <br />        <br />            <br />            <p>I am, one might say, a bit of an RSS junkie. It has been the main source of<br /><br />news and information for me for about the last year or so, but I began to<br /><br />feel as if I was drowning in it. I subscribe to something over 80 feeds,<br /><br />some of which, like techcrunch, spit out over 40 or 50 items a day. A few<br /><br />days away from my feed reader and there could be well over 1000 entries<br /><br />waiting when I got back. I had them split down into lots of different<br /><br />folders, based on interest, but it was just all getting too much, so I've<br /><br />adopted a simple strategy which has totally gotten over the problem. I could<br /><br />have just dropped all<br /><br /> I now only have 3 folders. Work Important, Personal Imortant and everything<br /><br />else. I'll read everything in the first two folders, but the threshold for<br /><br />getting into the first is very high, and the threshold for getting into the<br /><br />second is basically personal blogs from close friends. Everything else goes<br /><br />into the 3rd folder and if something doesn't jump out at me when I scan<br /><br />quickly through this folder then I just delete everything. Now the time to<br /><br />process all of these feeds is about 10 minutes.</p><br /><br /><p>I do have ideas about how to viksualise this river of information, but<br /><br />perhaps I'll leave those ideas until I get a Google App account.</p><br />        <br />    <br />                <p><br /><br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-rss.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a><br /><br /> | <br /><br />    <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00e398ef94740004?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a><br /><br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
