title: Swine flu t-shirts
---
I&#39;m sitting at home in London with a head cold. For the dew minutes it  <br>took me to check my temperature (37 thank you very much) I was  <br>wondering whether it might be the old swine flu, but no, just a normal  <br>head cold.<p>Made me think, someone should make a t-shirt with a biometric sensor  <br>that checks on true wearers&#39; temperature. No fever and it would say  <br>&quot;don&#39;t worry it&#39;s only a cold&quot;. Fever and, well there are lots of  <br>things it could say.
