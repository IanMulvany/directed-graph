At least I timed how long<br>it took to do the routes. 6a+ 3 min bang on. I then tried a 6b++<br>(wtf?) and that took 2.30 before I was totally shut down, wrong<br>sequence, too hard a route. I finished the night cruising a 6b, not<br>bad for the first week back. Did some traversing too, coming in at 4<br>and 3 min respectively.<p>Tuesday 13th<br>Donated a pint of blood, and that kind of whupped my ass for a couple of days.<p>Friday 16th<br>7.4 km, 47 min min<br><a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2474102">http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2474102</a><p>This was a clear 3 min faster over the same route. I was listening to<br>Cafe Del Mar.<p><br>Weekly Overview<p>Highlights<br>6b onsight at Westway on Monday.<br>Getting my milage in by hauling my ass out for a run on Friday night.<p>Lowlights:<br>being too tired during the week to do anything on the fingerboard, boo me.<p>tags: training, climbing
