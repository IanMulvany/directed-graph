title: sadly I've just discovered that vox sucks
---
<div><br />        <p>I have been liking using vox to blog, mainly because I can email a blog post<br /><br />from any email client. This significantly reduces the<br /><br />effort involved in posting a blog post.</p><br /><br /><p>I've just discovered that vox has enabled snap previews. I don't like them.<br /><br />OK, so, some people may like them, and that's OK, but I can't turn them off<br /><br />on my blog. That's not good.</p><br /><br /><p>In addition, when I email a link the link is now broken in vox, so if I type<br /><br />http://www.google.com you can see that link text but when I embed it in a <a href="http://www.google.com">link</a> the link does not work. boo.</p><br /><br /><p>I also like being able to blog pictures directly from flickr, I guess I am<br /><br />going to have to roll my own solution for a blog again at some point in the<br /><br />future when I have some time that will allow the bloggy thing to do what I<br /><br />want.</p><br /><br /><p>Ahh well.</p><br /><br /><p>tags: blog, suckiness, vox</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/sadly-ive-just-discovered-that-vox-sucks.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00e398ded8e00005?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
