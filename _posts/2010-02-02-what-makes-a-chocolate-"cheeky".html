title: what makes a chocolate "cheeky"
---

I&#39;m eating a chocolate bar which contains, I&#39;m told, a &#39;cheeky caramel<br>layer&#39;. It&#39;s shit like this that makes me despair of our modern<br>civilisation. According to the dictionary &#39;cheeky&#39; means &#39;impudent;<br>insolent&#39;, and it has the synonyms &#39;saucy, audacious, bold&#39;. I guess<br>that I am to feel that I have made a bold choice in opting for the<br>opulence provided by that extra caramel, but I can&#39;t raise the<br>enthusiasm to believe so.
