title: Identity systems, science and the internet
---

I just posted the following on a forum<br>(<a href="http://network.nature.com/groups/orcid/forum/topics/6547">http://network.nature.com/groups/orcid/forum/topics/6547</a>) on Nature<br>Network, I thought it was interesting enough to repost:<p><p>Bruce Schneier yesterday posted a very &quot;interesting<br>article&quot;:<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/02/anonymity_and_t_3.html">http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/02/anonymity_and_t_3.html</a><br>that gets to the heart of identity systems on the web. The bottom line<br>of the article is that anonymity will always be a given as the price<br>for introducing verification or coining systems will always be too<br>high, and even if present they won&#39;t be effective. Of course it is<br>just exactly such a system that ORCID is proposing to introduce. I<br>think there is a chance that it will work, as I believe that the<br>incentive system in science is stacked in favour or real identities,<br>however it does point to the idea that rather than real identities,<br>when we deal with online transactions (be they knowledge transactions<br>or social transactions), it is rather the scientific persona that we<br>should be supporting rather than nessecarrily the real identity of the<br>person.<p>That idea ties in with a discussion that has been going on in network<br>about whether we should allow personyms, and I read this other &quot;very<br>good piece&quot;:<a href="http://jonathanstray.com/identity-anonymity-and-controlling-trolls">http://jonathanstray.com/identity-anonymity-and-controlling-trolls</a><br>on that topic in the past week too which supports the idea of allowing<br>personyms, so long as they can be ascribed a trust score, but baulks<br>at the idea of forcing users to use their real identity.<p>For the good foreseeable future scientific identities are going to be<br>tied to real identities, but does anyone know of cases where<br>scientists have done good, acknowledged work under a pseudonym? Could<br>we imagine such a thing happening in the future? I know that sounds a<br>bit far fetched, but it&#39;s happened already in the open source<br>community a number of times, notably with &quot;why the lucky<br>stiff&quot;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff</a>.<p>tags: identity, science, ORCID
