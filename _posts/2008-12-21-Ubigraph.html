<div><br />        <p>Ubigraph (http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/) <a href="http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/">Ubigraph</a> (sorry for the<br /><br />fucked up formatting, I think my blog host vox is still being shitty<br /><br />at recognising simple html formatting in input, mixed with line<br /><br />breaks, it's just a frickin url link for god's sake) is a nicely<br /><br />implemented engine for making 3-D graphs and plots. I installed it and<br /><br />got the default python interface up and running in about 5 minutes. My<br /><br />initial reaction was &quot;this is cool&quot;. It runs on a server that you<br /><br />communicate with using an XML-RPC interface. Then I had a moment and<br /><br />realised that I couldn't think of anything, other than trying to plot<br /><br />graph relationships in citations, to do with it. I want to look at the<br /><br />graphing of these relationships, but need to find the time to mine<br /><br />some data first, so I'll just have to put this on the shelf for a<br /><br />moment. Before I do, I wanted to spin off a quick blog post to remind<br /><br />myself that this really was very easy to work with. You just create a<br /><br />graph object G. one could use this in conjunction with <a href="https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki">NetworkX</a> and subclass the<br /><br />ubigraph object from the networkx object and as you wrangled you<br /><br />networkx object you would see it appear in ubigraph, that would be<br /><br />cool.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/ubigraph.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fae8bb26a6000b?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
