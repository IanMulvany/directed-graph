<div> <p>OK, so I'm interested in installing the Connotea code base on my mac fordevelopment reasons. It will be the first time that I am going to startplaying around with a largish perl installation on my macine and there are alot of perl dependencies to be installed. Rather than going through CPANmodule by module, and rather than writing a bundle file for the connoteadependancies (because I don't know how to do that yet) I decided to try touse CPANPLUS, due to the tips  on perl administration withCPANPLUS</p><p>My first attempt to instal CPANPLUS didn't seem to get very far, then I readthat someone had succeeded by installing it into /Useres/Shared as root, sothat's what I tried and it seems to work. To be safe I ran the followingcommands on the advice of the program itself:</p><p>    $ perl bin/cpanp-boxed -s selfupdate dependencies    $ perl bin/cpanp-boxed -s selfupdate enabled_features</p> <p>   </p> </div>
